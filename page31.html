    <p class="p">
        Black holes are some of the strangest and most fascinating objects in space. They're extremely dense, with such strong gravitational attraction that not even light can escape their grasp. <br><br>

The Milky Way could contain over 100 million black holes, though detecting these gluttonous beasts is very difficult. At the heart of the Milky Way lies a supermassive black hole ‚Äî Sagittarius A*. The colossal structure is about 4 million times the mass of the sun and lies approximately 26,000 light-years away from Earth, according to a statement from NASA.<br><br>

The first image of a black hole was captured in 2019 by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration. The striking photo of the black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy 55 million light-years from Earth thrilled scientists around the world. 
</p>

<h1>How do black holes form?</h1>
<p class="p">
    Black holes are expected to form via two distinct channels. According to the first pathway, they are stellar corpses, so they form when massive stars die. Stars whose birth masses are above roughly 8 to 10 times mass of our sun, when they exhaust all their fuel ‚Äî their hydrogen ‚Äî they explode and die leaving behind a very compact dense object, a black hole. The resulting black hole that is left behind is referred to as a stellar mass black hole and its mass is of the order of a few times the mass of the sun. <br><br>

Not all stars leave behind black holes, stars with lower birth masses leave behind a neutron star or a white dwarf. Another way that black holes form is from the direct collapse of gas, a process that is expected to result in more massive black holes with a mass ranging from 1000 times the mass of the sun up to even 100,000 times the mass of the sun. This channel circumvents the formation of the traditional star, and is believed to operate in the early universe and produce more massive black hole seeds. 
</p>

<h1>Who discovered black holes?</h1>
<p class="p">
    Black holes were predicted as an exact mathematical solution to Einstein's equations. Einstein's equations describe the shape of space around matter. The theory of general relativity connects the geometry or shape of shape to the detailed distribution of matter.<br><br> 

The black hole solution was found was by Karl Schwarzschild in 1915, and these regions ‚Äî black holes ‚Äî were found to distort space extremally and generate a puncture in the fabric of spacetime. It was unclear at the time if these corresponded to real objects in the universe. Over time, as other end products of stellar death were detected, namely, neutron stars seen as pulsars it became clear that black holes were real and ought to exist. The first detected black hole was Cygnus-X1.
</p>

<h1>Do black holes die?</h1>
<p class="p">
    Black holes do not die per se, but they are theoretically predicted to eventually slowly evaporate over extremely long time scales.<br><br>

Black holes grow by the accretion of matter nearby that is pulled in by their immense gravity. Hawking predicted that black holes could also radiate away energy and shrink very slowly. Quantum theory suggests that there exist virtual particles popping in and out of existence all the time. When this happens, a particle and its companion anti-particle appear. However, they can also recombine and disappear again. When this process occurs near the event horizon of a black hole, strange things can happen. Instead of the particle antiparticle pair existing for a moment and then annihilating each other, one of them can get by gravity and fall into the black hole, while the other particle can fly off into space. Over very long timescales, we are speaking about timescales that are much much longer than the age of our universe, the theory states that this trickle of escaping particles will cause the black hole to slowly evaporate.
</p>

<h1>Are black holes wormholes?</h1>
<p class="p">
    No black holes are not wormholes. Wormholes can be thought of as tunnels that connect two separate points in space and time. It is believed that the interior of black holes could contain a wormhole, the puncture is spacetime, that could offer a portal to another point in spacetime potentially even in a different universe.
</p>

<h1>FIRST BLACK HOLE DISCOVERED</h1>
<p class="p">
    Albert Einstein first predicted the existence of black holes in 1916, with his general theory of relativity. The term "black hole" was coined many years later in 1967 by American astronomer John Wheeler. After decades of black holes being known only as theoretical objects.<br><br>

The first black hole ever discovered was Cygnus X-1, located within the Milky Way in the constellation of Cygnus, the Swan. Astronomers saw the first signs of a black hole in 1964 when a sounding rocket detected celestial sources of X-rays according to NASA. In 1971, astronomers determined that the X-rays were coming from a bright blue star orbiting a strange dark object. It was suggested that the detected X-rays were a result of stellar material being stripped away from the bright star and "gobbled" up by the dark object ‚Äî an all-consuming black hole.

<h1>HOW MANY BLACK HOLES ARE THERE?</h1>

<p class="p">
    According to the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) approximately one out of every thousand stars is massive enough to become a black hole. Since the Milky Way contains over 100 billion stars, our home galaxy must harbor some 100 million black holes.<br><br>

Though detecting black holes is a difficult task and estimates from NASA suggest there could be as many as 10 million to a billion stellar black holes in the Milky Way.<br><br>

The closest black hole to Earth is called Gaia-BH1, and it sits only 1,560 light-years away from us.

<h1>BLACK HOLE IMAGES</h1>

<p class="p">
    In 2019 the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration released the first image ever recorded of a black hole. The EHT saw the black hole in the center of galaxy M87 while the telescope was examining the event horizon or the area past which nothing can escape from a black hole. The image maps the sudden loss of photons (particles of light). It also opens up a whole new area of research in black holes, now that astronomers know what a black hole looks like.

    In 2021, astronomers revealed a new view of the giant black hole at the center of M87, showing what the colossal structure looks like in polarized light. As polarized light waves have a different orientation and brightness compared to unpolarized light, the new image shows the black hole in even more detail. Polarization is a signature of magnetic fields and the image makes it clear that the black hole's ring is magnetized.

<h1>WHAT DO BLACK HOLES LOOK LIKE?</h1>

<p class="p">
    Black holes have three "layers": the outer and inner event horizon, and the singularity.

The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary around the mouth of the black hole, past which light cannot escape. Once a particle crosses the event horizon, it cannot leave. Gravity is constant across the event horizon.

The inner region of a black hole, where the object's mass lies, is known as its singularity, the single point in space-time where the mass of the black hole is concentrated.

Scientists can't see black holes the way they can see stars and other objects in space. Instead, astronomers must rely on detecting the radiation black holes emit as dust and gas are drawn into the dense creatures. But supermassive black holes, lying in the center of a galaxy, may become shrouded by the thick dust and gas around them, which can block the telltale emissions. <br><br>

Sometimes, as matter is drawn toward a black hole, it ricochets off the event horizon and is hurled outward, rather than being tugged into the maw. Bright jets of material traveling at near-relativistic speeds are created. Although the black hole remains unseen, these powerful jets can be viewed from great distances.<br><br>

The EHT's image of a black hole in M87 (released in 2019) was an extraordinary effort, requiring two years of research even after the images were taken. That's because the collaboration of telescopes, which stretches across many observatories worldwide, produces an astounding amount of data that is too large to transfer via the internet.<br><br> 

With time, researchers expect to image other black holes and build up a repository of what the objects look like. The next target is likely Sagittarius A*, which is the black hole in the center of our own Milky Way galaxy. Sagittarius A* is intriguing because it is quieter than expected, which may be due to magnetic fields smothering its activity, a 2019 study reported. Another study that year showed that a cool gas halo surrounds Sagittarius A*, which gives unprecedented insight into what the environment around a black hole looks like.
