      The Indian subcontinent is a physiographical region in Southern Asia,
      mostly situated on the Indian Plate, projecting southwards into the Indian
      Ocean from the Himalayas. Geopolitically, it spans major landmasses from the 
      countries of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and
      Sri Lanka. Although the terms "Indian subcontinent" and "South Asia"
      are often used interchangeably to denote the region, the geopolitical 
      term of South Asia frequently includes Afghanistan, which is not 
      considered part of the subcontinent.<br>
      
      Geologically, the subcontinent originates from Insular India,
      an isolated landmass that rifted from the supercontinent of Gondwana during 
      the Cretaceous and merged with the landmass of Eurasia nearly 55 million years ago,
      forming the Himalayas. Historically, as well as to the present day,
      it is and has been the most populated region in the world, holding
      roughly 20‚Äì25 percent of the global population at all times in history. 
      Geographically, it is the peninsular region in Southern Asia located below the
      Third Pole, delineated by the Himalayas in the north, the Hindu Kush in the west, 
      and the Indo-Burman Ranges in the east. The neighboring geographical regions 
      around the subcontinent include the Tibetan Plateau to the north, the 
      Indochinese Peninsula to the east, the Iranian Plateau to the west, 
      and the Indian Ocean to the south.

<p class="p">
  The Indian subcontinent was formerly part of Gondwana, a supercontinent formed 
  during the late Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic. Gondwana began to break up 
  during the Mesozoic, with Insular India separating from Antarctica 130-120 million 
  years ago and Madagascar around 90 million years ago, during the Cretaceous. 
  Insular India subsequently drifted northeastwards, colliding with the Eurasian Plate 
  nearly 55 million years ago, during the Eocene, forming the Indian subcontinent.
  The zone where the Eurasian and Indian subcontinent plates meet remains geologically 
  active, prone to major earthquakes.

Physiographically, it is a peninsular region in South Asia delineated by the Himalayas
 in the north, the Hindu Kush in the west, and the Arakanese in the east. It extends 
 southward into the Indian Ocean with the Arabian Sea to the southwest and the Bay of 
 Bengal to the southeast. Most of this region rests on the Indian Plate and is 
 isolated from the rest of Asia by large mountain barriers. Laccadive Islands, 
 Maldives and the Chagos Archipelago are three series of coral atolls, cays and 
 Faroes on the Indian Plate along with the Chagos‚ÄìLaccadive Ridge, a submarine ridge 
 that was generated by the northern drift of the Indian Plate over the R√©union hotspot 
 during the Cretaceous and early Cenozoic times. The Maldives archipelago rises from
  a basement of volcanic basalt outpourings from a depth of about 2000 m forming the 
  central part of the ridge between Laccadives and the Great Chagos Bank.

<p class="p">According to anthropologist Patrap C. Dutta, "the Indian subcontinent 
  occupies the major landmass of South Asia."[42] According to historian B. N. Mukherjee,
   "The subcontinent is an indivisible geographical entity."[43] According to geographer 
   Dudley Stamp, "there is perhaps no mainland part of the world better marked off by 
   nature as a region or a 'realm' by itself than the Indian subcontinent."[44]</p>

  This natural physical landmass in South Asia is the dry-land portion of the Indian 
  Plate, which has been relatively isolated from the rest of Eurasia. 
  The Himalayas (from Brahmaputra River in the east to Indus River in the west), 
  Karakoram (from Indus River in the east to Yarkand River in the west) and the Hindu 
  Kush mountains (from Yarkand River westwards) form its northern boundary. 
  In the west it is bounded by parts of the mountain ranges of Hindu Kush, Spƒ´n Ghar 
  (Safed Koh), Sulaiman Mountains, Kirthar Mountains, Brahui range, and Pab range 
  among others,with the Western Fold Belt along the border 
  (between the Sulaiman Range and the Chaman Fault) is the western boundary of the 
  Indian Plate, where, along the Eastern Hindu Kush, lies the Afghanistan‚ÄìPakistan border.
  In the east, it is bounded by Patkai, Naga, Lushai and Chin hills. 
  The Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea form the boundary of the Indian 
  subcontinent in the south, south-east and south-west.</p>

  The rocky interiors of the Himalayas
  Given the difficulty of passage through the Himalayas, the sociocultural, religious 
  and political interaction of the Indian subcontinent has largely been through the 
  valleys of Afghanistan in its northwest,[citation needed] the valleys of Manipur 
  in its east, and by maritime routes. More difficult but historically important 
  interaction has also occurred through passages pioneered by the Tibetans. These 
  routes and interactions have led to the spread of Buddhism out of the subcontinent 
  into other parts of Asia. The Islamic expansion arrived into the subcontinent in two 
  ways: through Afghanistan on land, and to the Indian coast through the maritime routes
   on the Arabian Sea.
  
</p>

<h1 id="geopolitics">Geopolitics</h1>
<p class="p">
  In terms of modern geopolitical boundaries, the subcontinent constitutes Bangladesh, 
  Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Pakistan, besides, by convention, the island country of Sri 
  Lanka and other nearby island nations of the Indian Ocean, such as Maldives and the 
  British Indian Ocean Territory.[citation needed][original research?
   Unlike "South Asia" sometimes the expression "Indian subcontinent" may exclude the 
   islands of Maldives and Sri Lanka. According to Pawan Budhwar, Arup Varma, 
   and Manjusha Hirekhan, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and
    Bhutan constitute the Indian subcontinent. Budhwar, Varma, and Hirekhan also 
    maintain that with Afghanistan and Maldives included the region is referred to as 
    South Asia. The periphery of the subcontinent, including Pakistan, Bangladesh 
    and the island chains of the Maldives, features large Muslim populations, while the
     heartland, including most of India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, are overwhelmingly Hindu 
     or Buddhist. Since most of these countries are located on the Indian Plate, a 
     continuous landmass, the borders between countries are often either a river or 
     a no man's land.<br>

The precise definition of an "Indian subcontinent" in a geopolitical context is somewhat 
contested as there is no globally accepted definition on which countries are a part of 
South Asia or the Indian subcontinent. Whether called the Indian subcontinent or South 
Asia, the definition of the geographical extent of this region varies.
 Afghanistan, despite often considered as a part of South Asia, is usually not included 
 in the Indian subcontinent.
  Maldives, an island country consisting of a small archipelago southwest of the 
  peninsula, while largely considered a part of the Indian subcontinent,
   sometimes is mentioned by sources, including the International Monetary Fund, as a 
   group of islands away from the Indian subcontinent in a south-western direction.
