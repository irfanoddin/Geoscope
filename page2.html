        <p class="p">
        The history of cartography refers to the development and consequences of 
        cartography, or mapmaking technology, throughout human history. Maps have been 
        one of the most important human inventions for millennia, allowing humans to 
        explain and navigate their way through the world.<br>

        When and how the earliest maps were made is unclear, but maps of local terrain
        are believed to have been independently invented by many cultures. The earliest
        surviving maps include cave paintings and etchings on tusk and stone. Maps 
        were produced extensively by ancient Babylon, Greece, Rome, China, and India.<br>
        
        The earliest maps ignored the curvature of Earth's surface, both because the 
        shape of the Earth was uncertain and because the curvature is not important 
        across the small areas being mapped. However, since the age of Classical Greece, 
        maps of large regions, and especially of the world, have used projection from 
        a model globe to control how the inevitable distortion gets apportioned on the 
        map.<br>
        
        Modern methods of transportation, the use of surveillance aircraft, and more 
        recently the availability of satellite imagery have made documentation of many 
        areas possible that were previously inaccessible. Free online services such as 
        Google Earth have made accurate maps of the world more accessible than ever 
        before.

    <h1>Etymology</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p class="p">
        The English term cartography is modern, borrowed from the French cartographie in
         the 1840s, itself based on Middle Latin carta "map".

    <p class="p">It is not always clear whether an ancient artifact had been wrought as a 
        map or as something else. The definition of "map" is also not precise. Thus, 
        no single artifact is generally accepted to be the earliest surviving map. 
        Candidates include:<br><br>
        1. A map-like representation of a mountain, river, valleys and routes around 
        Pavlov in the Czech Republic, carved on a mammoth tusk, that has been dated to 
        25,000 BC.<br>
        2. An Aboriginal Australian cylcon that may be as much as 20,000 years old that 
        is thought to depict the Darling River.<br>
        3. A map etched on a mammoth bone at Mezhyrich that is about 15,000 years old.<br>
        4. Dots dating to 14,500 BC found on the walls of the Lascaux caves map of part 
        of the night sky, including the three bright stars Vega, Deneb, and Altair 
        (the Summer Triangle asterism), as well as the Pleiades star cluster. 
        The Cuevas de El Castillo in Spain that contains a dot map of the Corona 
        Borealis constellation dating from 12,000 BC.<br>
        5. A polished chunk of sandstone from a cave in Spanish Navarre, dated to 14,000
        BC, that may be symbols for landscape features, such as hills or dwellings,
        superimposed on animal etchings. Alternatively, it may also represent a 
        spiritual landscape, or simple incisings.<br>
        6. Another ancient picture that resembles a map that was created in the late 7th 
        millennium BC in √áatalh√∂y√ºk, Anatolia, modern Turkey. This wall painting may 
        represent a plan of this Neolithic village; however, recent scholarship has 
        questioned the identification of this painting as a map.<br>
        7. The "Saint-B√©lec slab" (2200‚Äì1600 BC), whose lines and symbols have been 
        argued to represent a cadastral plan of a part of western Brittany.

    <p class="p">
        Maps in Ancient Babylonia were made by using accurate surveying techniques. 
        For example, a 7.6 √ó 6.8 cm clay tablet found in 1930 at Ga-Sur, near contemporary
        Kirkuk, shows a map of a river valley between two hills. Cuneiform inscriptions 
        label the features on the map, including a plot of land described as 354 iku 
        (12 hectares) that was owned by a person called Azala. Most scholars date the 
        tablet to the 25th to 24th century BC. Hills are shown by overlapping semicircles, 
        rivers by lines, and cities by circles. The map also is marked to show the 
        cardinal directions. An engraved map from the Kassite period (14th‚Äì12th centuries 
        BC) of Babylonian history shows walls and buildings in the holy city of Nippur.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
        The Babylonian World Map, the earliest surviving map of the world (c.‚Äâ600 BC), 
        is a symbolic, not a literal representation. It deliberately omits peoples such 
        as the Persians and Egyptians, who were well known to the Babylonians. The area 
        shown is depicted as a circular shape surrounded by water, which fits the 
        religious image of the world in which the Babylonians believed.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
        Phoenician sailors made major advances in seafaring and exploration. It is 
        recorded that the first circumnavigation of Africa was possibly undertaken by 
        Phoenician explorers employed by Egyptian pharaoh Necho II c. 610‚Äì595 BC. 
        In The Histories, written 431‚Äì425 BC, Herodotus cast doubt on a report of the 
        Sun observed shining from the north. He stated that the phenomenon was observed 
        by Phoenician explorers during their circumnavigation of Africa (The Histories, 
        4.42) who claimed to have had the Sun on their right when circumnavigating in a 
        clockwise direction. To modern historians, these details confirm the truth of 
        the Phoenicians' report, and even suggest the possibility that the Phoenicians 
        knew about the spherical Earth model. However, nothing certain about their 
        knowledge of geography and navigation has survived. The historian Dmitri 
        Panchenko theorizes that it was the Phoenician circumnavigation of Africa that 
        inspired the theory of a spherical Earth by the 5th century BC.

        <b>Pomponius Mela</b><br>
        Pomponius Mela is unique among ancient geographers in that, after dividing the
         earth into five zones, of which two only were habitable, he asserts the existence
          of antichthones, inhabiting the southern temperate zone inaccessible to the 
          folk of the northern temperate regions from the unbearable heat of the 
          intervening torrid belt. On the divisions and boundaries of Europe, Asia and 
          Africa, he repeats Eratosthenes; like all classical geographers from Alexander 
          the Great (except Ptolemy) he regards the Caspian Sea as an inlet of the 
          Northern Ocean, corresponding to the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea on the 
          south.<br><br>
        <b>Marinus of Tyre</b><br>
        Marinus of Tyre was a Hellenized Phoenician geographer and cartographer.
         He founded mathematical geography and provided the underpinnings of Ptolemy's 
         influential Geographia.Marinus's geographical treatise is lost and known only 
         from Ptolemy's remarks. He introduced improvements to the construction of maps 
         and developed a system of nautical charts. His chief legacy is that he first 
         assigned to each place a proper latitude and longitude. His zero meridian ran 
         through the westernmost land known to him, the Isles of the Blessed around the
          location of the Canary or Cape Verde Islands. He used the parallel of Rhodes 
          for measurements of latitude. Ptolemy mentions several revisions of Marinus's 
          geographical work, which is often dated to AD 114 although this is uncertain. 
          Marinus estimated a length of 180,000 stadia for the equator, roughly 
          corresponding to a circumference of the Earth of 33,300 km, about 17% less 
          than the actual value.<br><br>
   
        He also carefully studied the works of his predecessors and the diaries of 
        travelers. His maps were the first in the Roman Empire to show China. He also 
        invented equirectangular projection, which is still used in map creation today. 
        A few of Marinus's opinions are reported by Ptolemy. Marinus was of the opinion 
        that the World Ocean was separated into an eastern and a western part by the 
        continents of Europe, Asia and Africa. He thought that the inhabited world 
        stretched in latitude from Thule (Norway) to Agisymba (around the Tropic of
         Capricorn) and in longitude from the Isles of the Blessed (around the Canaries) 
         to Shera (China). Marinus also coined the term Antarctic, referring to the 
         opposite of the Arctic Circle.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
        <b>Ptolemy</b><br>
        Ptolemy (90‚Äì168), a Hellenized Egyptian,thought that, with the aid of astronomy 
        and mathematics, the Earth could be mapped very accurately. Ptolemy revolutionized
         the depiction of the spherical Earth on a map by using perspective projection, 
         and suggested precise methods for fixing the position of geographic features 
         on its surface using a coordinate system with parallels of latitude and meridians
          of longitude.<br><br>

Ptolemy's eight-volume atlas Geographia is a prototype of modern mapping and GIS.
 It included an index of place-names, with the latitude and longitude of each place 
 to guide the search, scale, conventional signs with legends, and the practice of 
 orienting maps so that north is at the top and east to the right of the map‚Äîan almost 
 universal custom today.<br><br>

Yet with all his important innovations, however, Ptolemy was not infallible. His
 most important error was a miscalculation of the circumference of the Earth. He 
 believed that Eurasia covered 180¬∞ of the globe, which convinced Christopher Columbus
  to sail across the Atlantic to look for a simpler and faster way to travel to India. 
  Had Columbus known that the true figure was much greater, it is conceivable that he 
  would never have set out on his momentous voyage.

<h1>China</h1>
<p class="p">
   The earliest known maps to have survived in China date to the 4th century BC.In 
   1986, seven ancient Chinese maps were found in an archeological excavation of a 
   Qin State tomb in what is now Fangmatan, in the vicinity of Tianshui City, Gansu.
   Before this find, the earliest extant maps that were known came from the Mawangdui 
   Han tomb excavation in 1973, which found three maps on silk dated to the 2nd century
    BC in the early Han dynasty.The 4th-century BC maps from the State of Qin were drawn 
    with black ink on wooden blocks.These blocks fortunately survived in soaking 
    conditions due to underground water that had seeped into the tomb; the quality of
     the wood had much to do with their survival.After two years of slow-drying 
     techniques, the maps were fully restored.<br> <br>

The territory shown in the seven Qin maps overlap each other. The maps display tributary 
river systems of the Jialing River in Sichuan, in a total measured area of 107 by 68 km.
The maps featured rectangular symbols encasing character names for the locations of 
administrative counties. Rivers and roads are displayed with similar line symbols; this 
makes interpreting the map somewhat difficult, although the labels of rivers placed in 
order of stream flow are helpful to modern day cartographers.These maps also feature 
locations where different types of timber can be gathered, while two of the maps state 
the distances in mileage to the timber sites.In light of this, these maps are perhaps the 
oldest economic maps in the world since they predate Strabo's economic maps.<br><br>

In addition to the seven maps on wooden blocks found at Tomb 1 of Fangmatan, a fragment 
of a paper map was found on the chest of the occupant of Tomb 5 of Fangmatan in 1986. 
This tomb is dated to the early Western Han, so the map dates to the early 2nd century BC.
 The map shows topographic features such as mountains, waterways and roads, and is thought
  to cover the area of the preceding Qin Kingdom.

<p class="p">
     <b>Earliest geographical writing</b><br>
     In China, the earliest known geographical Chinese writing dates back to the 5th 
     century BC, during the beginning of the Warring States (481‚Äì221 BC).
     This was the Yu Gong or Tribute of Yu chapter of the Shu Jing or Book of Documents. 
     The book describes the traditional nine provinces, their kinds of soil, their 
     characteristic products and economic goods, their tributary goods, their trades and 
     vocations, their state revenues and agricultural systems, and the various rivers and
      lakes listed and placed accordingly.The nine provinces in the time of this 
      geographical work were very small in size compared to their modern Chinese 
      counterparts. The Yu Gong's descriptions pertain to areas of the Yellow River, 
      the lower valleys of the Yangzi, with the plain between them and the Shandong 
      Peninsula, and to the west the most northern parts of the Wei River and the Han 
      River were known (along with the southern parts of modern-day Shanxi).
</p>
<p class="p">
   <b>Earliest known reference to a map (Âúñ t√∫)</b> <br>    
   The oldest reference to a map in China comes from the 3rd century BC. This was the 
   event of 227 BC where Crown Prince Dan of Yan had his assassin Jing Ke visit the 
   court of the ruler of the State of Qin, who would become the first leader to unify 
   China, Qin Shi Huang (r. 221‚Äì210 BC). Jing Ke was to present the ruler of Qin with a 
   district map painted on a silk scroll, rolled up and held in a case where he hid his 
   assassin's dagger. Handing to him the map of the designated territory was the first 
   diplomatic act of submitting that district to Qin rule.Jing then tried and failed to
    kill him. From then on, maps were frequently mentioned in Chinese sources.

        north at the bottom).
    </i></p>
</aside>

<p class="p">
    <b>Han dynasty</b><br>
    The three Han dynasty maps found at Mawangdui differ from the earlier Qin State maps.
     While the Qin maps place the cardinal direction of north at the top of the map, the 
     Han maps are orientated with the southern direction at the top. 
      The Han maps are also more complex, since they cover a much larger area, employ a 
      large number of well-designed map symbols, and include additional information on 
      local military sites and the local population. The Han maps also note measured 
      distances between certain places, but a formal graduated scale and rectangular 
      grid system for maps would not be used‚Äîor at least described in full‚Äîuntil the 
      3rd century (see Pei Xiu below). Among the three maps found at Mawangdui was a 
      small map representing the tomb area where it was found, a larger topographical 
      map showing the Han's borders along the subordinate Kingdom of Changsha and the 
      Nanyue kingdom (of northern Vietnam and parts of modern Guangdong and Guangxi), 
      and a map which marks the positions of Han military garrisons that were employed 
      in an attack against Nanyue in 181 BC.<br><br>

An early text that mentioned maps was the Rites of Zhou. Although attributed to the 
 era of the Zhou dynasty, its first recorded appearance was in the libraries of Prince 
 Liu De (c.‚Äâ130 BC), and was compiled and commented on by Liu Xin in the 1st century AD. 
 It outlined the use of maps that were made for governmental provinces and districts, 
 principalities, frontier boundaries, and even pinpointed locations of ores and minerals 
 for mining facilities. Upon the investiture of three of his sons as feudal 
 princes in 117 BC, Emperor Wu of Han had maps of the entire empire submitted to him.
<br><br>

From the 1st century AD onwards, official Chinese historical texts contained a 
geographical section (Âú∞ÁêÜÁ∫™; Diliji), which was often an enormous compilation of changes 
in place-names and local administrative divisions controlled by the ruling dynasty, 
descriptions of mountain ranges, river systems, taxable products, etc. From the 5th
 century BC Shu Jing forward, Chinese geographical writing provided more concrete 
 information and less legendary element. This example can be seen in the 4th chapter of 
 the Huainanzi (Book of the Master of Huainan), compiled under the editorship of Prince 
 Liu An in 139 BC during the Han dynasty (202 BC‚Äì202 AD). The chapter gave general 
 descriptions of topography in a systematic fashion, given visual aids by the use of 
 maps (di tu) due to the efforts of Liu An and his associate Zuo Wu. In Chang Chu's Hua 
 Yang Guo Chi ("Historical Geography of Sichuan") of 347, not only rivers, trade routes, 
 and various tribes were described, but it also wrote of a 'Ba June Tu Jing' 
 ("Map of Sichuan"), which had been made much earlier in 150.<br><br>

Local mapmaking such as the one of Sichuan mentioned above, became a widespread tradition
 of Chinese geographical works by the 6th century, as noted in the bibliography of the Sui
  Shu. It is during this time of the Southern and Northern Dynasties that the Liang 
  dynasty (502‚Äì557) cartographers also began carving maps into stone steles 
  (alongside the maps already drawn and painted on paper and silk).

      1:1,060,000. Many of the oldest surviving maps from China dates between the 16th
       to 17th centuries, these include the Sihai Huayi Zongtu (1532) and the Shanhai Yudi
        Quantu (1609). Similar to these, the earliest European style map from China, 
        the Kunyu Wanguo Quantu (1602) influenced and was exported to Japan and Korea. 
         By this time, Jesuit missionaries contributed to similar maps such as the Wanguo 
         Quantu (1620s)[59] and the Kunyu Quantu (1674).[60] While the Selden Map (c.‚Äâ17th 
         century) employs a system of navigational routes emanating from ports in China. 
         The Mao Kun map published in 1628 is thought to be based on a strip map dated to 
         the voyages of Zheng He.<br><br>

In 1579, Luo Hongxian published the Guang Yutu atlas, including more than 40 maps, a 
grid system, and a systematic way of representing major landmarks such as mountains, 
rivers, roads and borders. The Guang Yutu incorporates the discoveries of the naval 
explorer Zheng He's 15th-century voyages along the coasts of China, Southeast Asia, 
India and Africa.

    In 1402, Yi Hoe and Kwan Yun created a world map largely based from Chinese

    world maps from East Asia. Another notable pre-modern map is the Cheonhado map 
    developed in Korea in the 17th century.<br><br>

    Sekisui Nagakubo produced a world map in 1785 called the Comprehensive Map and 
    Description of the Geography of the Myriad Countries of the Globe 
    (Âú∞ÁêÉËê¨ÂúãÂ±±Êµ∑ËºøÂú∞ÂÖ®ÂúñË™™), mainly deriving it from an earlier map made by Matteo Ricci. 
    The production was made by woodblock print and folded into paper boards, he made 
    corrections and additions on top of Matteo's production. This was one of the earliest 
    maps with longitude and latitude information in Japan and was written in Katakana.<br><br>
    
    Another well-known cartographer of the late-Edo period was Ino Tadataka, he is known 
    for completing the first map of Japan using modern surveying techniques. 
    His most famous work, the Dai Nihon Enkai Yochi Zenzu (Â§ßÊó•Êú¨Ê≤øÊµ∑ËºøÂú∞ÂÖ®Âõ≥) consisted of
     three large map pages at a scale of 1:432,000 and it showed the entire country on 
     eight pages at 1:216,000. Some of his maps are accurate to 1/1000 of a degree, 
     which allowed it to become the definitive maps used in Japan for nearly a century.
      Maps based on his work were in use as late as 1924.

      <b>Ancient India</b>  <br>
      Indian cartographic traditions covered the locations of the Pole star and other 
      constellations of use. These charts may have been in use by the beginning of the 
      Common Era for purposes of navigation.<br><br>

Detailed maps of considerable length describing the locations of settlements, sea shores, 
rivers, and mountains were also made. The 8th-century scholar Bhavabhuti conceived 
paintings which indicated geographical regions.<br><br>

Italian scholar Francesco Lorenzo Pull√® reproduced a number of ancient Indian maps in 
his magnum opus La Cartografia Antica dell'India. Out of these maps, two have been 
reproduced using a manuscript of Lokaprakasa, originally compiled by the polymath 
Ksemendra (Kashmir, 11th century), as a source. The other manuscript, used as a source 
by Pull√®, is titled Samgrahani. The early volumes of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica also 
described cartographic charts made by the Dravidian people of India.<br><br>

<b>Mughal era</b><br>
Maps from the Ain-e-Akbari, a Mughal document detailing India's history and traditions, 
contain references to locations indicated in earlier Indian cartographic traditions.
Another map describing the kingdom of Nepal, four feet in length and about two and a 
half feet in breadth, was presented to Warren Hastings. In this map the mountains were 
elevated above the surface, and several geographical elements were indicated in different 
colors.<br><br>

The scholar Sadiq Isfahani of Jaunpur compiled an atlas of the parts of the world which 
he held to be 'suitable for human life'. The 32 sheet atlas‚Äîwith maps oriented towards 
the south as was the case with Islamic works of the era‚Äîis part of a larger scholarly 
work compiled by Isfahani during 1647 CE. According to Joseph E. Schwartzberg (2008): 
'The largest known Indian map, depicting the former Rajput capital at Amber in remarkable 
house-by-house detail, measures 661 √ó 645 cm. (260 √ó 254 in., or approximately 22 √ó 21 ft).

      <b>Arab and Persian cartography</b><br><br>
      In the Middle Ages, Muslim scholars continued and advanced on the mapmaking 
      traditions of earlier cultures. Most used Ptolemy's methods; but they also took 
      advantage of what explorers and merchants learned in their travels across the 
      Muslim world, from Spain to India to Africa, and beyond in trade relationships 
      with China, and Russia.<br><br>

An important influence in the development of cartography was the patronage of the Abbasid 
caliph, al-Ma'mun, who reigned from 813 to 833. He commissioned several geographers to 
remeasure the distance on earth that corresponds to one degree of celestial meridian. 
Thus his patronage resulted in the refinement of the definition of the mile used by Arabs 
(mƒ´l in Arabic) in comparison to the stadion used by Greeks. These efforts also enabled
 Muslims to calculate the circumference of the earth. Al-Mamun also commanded the 
 production of a large map of the world, which has not survived, though it is known that 
 its map projection type was based on Marinus of Tyre rather than Ptolemy.<br><br>

Also in the 9th century, the Persian mathematician and geographer, Habash al-Hasib 
al-Marwazi, employed spherical trigonometry and map projection methods to convert polar 
coordinates to a different coordinate system centred on a specific point on the sphere, 
in this the Qibla, the direction to Mecca. Ab≈´ RayhƒÅn Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´ (973‚Äì1048) later developed 
ideas which are seen as an anticipation of the polar coordinate system. Around 1025, he 
describes a polar equi-azimuthal equidistant projection of the celestial sphere. However, 
this type of projection had been used in ancient Egyptian star-maps and was not to be 
fully developed until the 15 and 16th centuries.<br><br>

In the early 10th century, Ab≈´ Zayd al-Balkhƒ´, originally from Balkh, founded the 
"Balkhƒ´ school" of terrestrial mapping in Baghdad. The geographers of this school also 
wrote extensively of the peoples, products, and customs of areas in the Muslim world, 
with little interest in the non-Muslim realms. The "Balkhƒ´ school", which included 
geographers such as Estakhri, al-Muqaddasi and Ibn Hawqal, produced world atlases, 
each one featuring a world map and twenty regional maps.<br><br>

SuhrƒÅb, a late 10th-century Muslim geographer, accompanied a book of geographical 
coordinates with instructions for making a rectangular world map, with equirectangular 
projection or cylindrical equidistant projection. The earliest surviving rectangular 
coordinate map is dated to the 13th century and is attributed to Hamdallah al-Mustaqfi
 al-Qazwini, who based it on the work of SuhrƒÅb. The orthogonal parallel lines were 
 separated by one degree intervals, and the map was limited to Southwest Asia and Central
  Asia. The earliest surviving world maps based on a rectangular coordinate grid are 
  attributed to al-Mustawfi in the 14th or 15th century (who used invervals of ten degrees
   for the lines), and to Hafiz-i Abru (died 1430).<br><br>

Ibn Battuta (1304‚Äì1368?) wrote "Rihlah" (Travels) based on three decades of journeys, 
covering more than 120,000 km through northern Africa, southern Europe, and much of Asia.

       <b>Book on the appearance of the Earth</b><br><br>
       Muhammad ibn M≈´sƒÅ al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´'s KitƒÅb ·π£≈´rat al-Ar·∏ç ("Book on the appearance of 
       the Earth") was completed in 833. It is a revised and completed version of 
       Ptolemy's Geography, consisting of a list of 2402 coordinates of cities and 
       other geographical features following a general introduction.<br><br>

Al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´, Al-Ma'mun's most famous geographer, corrected Ptolemy's gross overestimate 
for the length of the Mediterranean Sea (from the Canary Islands to the eastern shores of 
the Mediterranean); Ptolemy overestimated it at 63 degrees of longitude, 
while al-Khwarizmi almost correctly estimated it at nearly 50 degrees of longitude. 
Al-Ma'mun's geographers "also depicted the Atlantic and Indian Oceans as open bodies 
of water, not land-locked seas as Ptolemy had done." Al-Khwarizmi thus set the Prime 
Meridian of the Old World at the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, 10‚Äì13 degrees to the
 east of Alexandria (the prime meridian previously set by Ptolemy) and 70 degrees to the 
 west of Baghdad. Most medieval Muslim geographers continued to use al-Khwarizmi's 
 prime meridian. Other prime meridians used were set by Ab≈´ Muhammad al-Hasan 
 al-HamdƒÅnƒ´ and Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi at Ujjain, a centre of Indian astronomy, 
 and by another anonymous writer at Basra.<br><br>

<b>Al-Biruni</b><br><br>
Abu Rayhan al-Biruni (973‚Äì1048) gave an estimate of 6,339.6 km for the Earth radius, 
which is only 17.15 km less than the modern value of 6,356.7523142 km (WGS84 polar radius
 "b"). In contrast to his predecessors who measured the Earth's circumference by sighting
  the Sun simultaneously from two different locations, Al-Biruni developed a new method 
  of using trigonometric calculations based on the angle between a plain and mountain top 
  which yielded more accurate measurements of the Earth's circumference and made it
   possible for it to be measured by a single person from a single location.
    Al-Biruni's method's motivation was to avoid "walking across hot, dusty deserts" and 
    the idea came to him when he was on top of a tall mountain in India 
    (present day Pind Dadan Khan, Pakistan).[81] From the top of the mountain, he 
    sighted the dip angle which, along with the mountain's height (which he calculated 
    beforehand), he applied to the law of sines formula. This was the earliest known use 
    of dip angle and the earliest practical use of the law of sines.<br><br>

Around 1025, Al-Biruni was the first to describe a polar equi-azimuthal equidistant 
projection of the celestial sphere.<br>

In his Codex Masudicus (1037), Al-Biruni theorized the existence of a landmass along the 
vast ocean between Asia and Europe, or what is today known as the Americas. He deduced 
its existence on the basis of his accurate estimations of the Earth's circumference and 
Afro-Eurasia's size, which he found spanned only two-fifths of the Earth's circumference,
 and his discovery of the concept of specific gravity, from which he deduced that the 
 geological processes that gave rise to Eurasia must've also given rise to lands in the 
 vast ocean between Asia and Europe. He also theorized that the landmass must be inhabited
  by human beings, which he deduced from his knowledge of humans inhabiting the broad 
  north‚Äìsouth band stretching from Russia to South India and Sub-Saharan Africa, 
  theorizing that the landmass would most likely lie along the same band. 
  He was the first to predict "the existence of land to the east and west of Eurasia, 
  which later on was discovered to be America and Japan".
