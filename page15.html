         <p class="p">
            Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the sun in our solar system. 
            It was discovered in 1846 by Johann Galle and Heinrich d'Arrest, after they
             calculated its position based on mathematical predictions made by French 
             mathematician Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune is named after the Roman god of 
             the sea, and is known for its beautiful blue color, strong winds, and 
             fascinating moons.<br.<br>

            Physical Characteristics:
            Neptune is about four times the size of Earth, with a diameter of 
            approximately 49,244 kilometers. It is composed of hydrogen, helium,
             and methane, which give the planet its blue color. Neptune has a relatively 
             low density, indicating that it has a rocky core surrounded by a thick layer
              of ice and gas. The planet also has a faint ring system, which was 
              discovered in 1984 by the Voyager 2 spacecraft.<br><br>
            
            Atmosphere:
            Neptune's atmosphere is very similar to Uranus's, as it is primarily
             composed of hydrogen and helium, with small amounts of methane. The 
             methane in Neptune's atmosphere gives the planet its distinctive blue 
             color, as it absorbs red light and reflects blue light. The atmosphere 
             also contains clouds of methane ice crystals, which are thought to 
             contribute to the planet's weather patterns. Neptune has the strongest 
             winds in our solar system, with speeds reaching up to 2,100 kilometers per
              hour.<br><br>
            
            Moons:
            Neptune has 14 known moons, the largest of which is Triton. Triton is one 
            of the most unusual moons in our solar system, as it is the only large moon
            in our solar system that orbits its planet in the opposite direction to its
             planet's rotation. It is also thought to be a captured Kuiper Belt object.
              Other notable moons include Nereid, Proteus, and Despina.<br><br>
            
            Exploration:
            Neptune has only been visited by one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which flew by 
            the planet in 1989. The mission provided us with our first close-up look at
             Neptune and its moons, and it discovered several new moons and a faint ring 
             system. Although no future missions to Neptune have been planned, scientists
              are still studying the data from Voyager 2 to learn more about this 
              enigmatic planet.<br><br>
            
            Neptune's Great Dark Spot:
            One of the most fascinating features of Neptune is its Great Dark Spot, 
            which is a massive storm system in the planet's atmosphere that is similar
             in size to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. The Great Dark Spot was first 
             observed by Voyager 2 in 1989, but it had disappeared by the time the Hubble 
             Space Telescope observed Neptune in 1994. It is thought that the Great Dark
              Spot is a large anticyclone, which is a high-pressure system that rotates
               counterclockwise.<br.<br>
            
            Conclusion:
            Neptune is a fascinating and mysterious planet, with its beautiful blue 
            color, strong winds, and unusual moons. Although it has only been visited 
            by one spacecraft, the data obtained by Voyager 2 has provided us with 
            valuable information about Neptune and its system of moons and rings.
             Future missions to Neptune could help us to unlock even more secrets about 
             this distant and enigmatic planet.
