            Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun and is the third-largest planet 
            in our solar system. It was first discovered in 1781 by the British 
            astronomer William Herschel. Uranus is named after the Greek god of the 
            sky and is known for its unusual tilt and unique features. Here are some 
            interesting facts about Uranus:<br><br>

            Physical Characteristics:
            Uranus has a diameter of about 50,724 kilometers, making it about four times
             larger than Earth. It is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with
              small amounts of methane, which give the planet its blue-green color. 
              Uranus has a low density, which suggests that it has a relatively small 
              rocky core surrounded by a thick layer of ice and gas. The planet also 
              has a weak magnetic field, which is about 50 times weaker than Earth's 
              magnetic field.<br><br>
            
            Tilt:
            One of the most notable features of Uranus is its unusual tilt. Unlike 
            the other planets in our solar system, which rotate more or less upright, 
            Uranus rotates on its side, with its axis tilted at an angle of about 98 
            degrees. This unusual tilt is thought to be the result of a massive 
            collision early in the planet's history. As a result, Uranus experiences
             extreme seasons, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous 
             sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness.<br><br>
            
            Moons:
            Uranus has 27 known moons, the largest of which is Titania. Other 
            notable moons include Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda. Miranda is
            particularly interesting because it has a highly varied terrain, with
             areas of heavily cratered terrain, canyons, and ridges.<br><br>
            
            Rings:
            Uranus has a system of 13 rings, which are composed of rock and ice 
            particles ranging in size from dust to boulders. The rings were first 
            discovered in 1977, and they are much darker than the rings of Saturn.<br><br>
            
            Atmosphere:
            Uranus's atmosphere is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, with small 
            amounts of methane, which give the planet its blue-green color. The 
            atmosphere also contains clouds of ammonia and water vapor, which are 
            thought to contribute to the planet's extreme weather. Uranus has extremely 
            strong winds, which can reach speeds of up to 900 kilometers per hour, and
             it is also home to some of the coldest temperatures in our solar system, 
             with temperatures dropping as low as -224 degrees Celsius.<br><br>
            
            Exploration:
            Uranus has been visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which flew by 
            the planet in 1986. The mission provided us with our first close-up look 
            at the planet and its moons, and it also discovered several new moons and 
            rings. However, because of its distance from Earth, Uranus has not been 
            studied in as much detail as some of the other planets in our solar
             system.<br><br>
            
            Conclusion:
            Uranus is a unique and fascinating planet with many interesting features,
             such as its unusual tilt, system of moons and rings, and extreme weather 
             conditions. Although we have only been able to study Uranus in detail 
             with one spacecraft, future missions to the planet could provide us with 
             even more knowledge and insight into this enigmatic world.
