    <p class="p">
    A <b>continent</b> is any of several large geographical regions. Continents are 
    generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria. A continent 
    could be a single landmass or a part of a very large landmass, as in the case of 
    Asia or Europe. Due to this, the number of continents varies; up to seven or as few 
    as four geographical regions are commonly regarded as continents. Most English-
    speaking countries recognize seven regions as continents. In order from largest to 
    smallest in area, these seven regions are Asia, Africa, North America, South America, 
    Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. Different variations with fewer continents merge
    some of these regions; examples of this are merging North America and South America
    into America, Asia and Europe into Eurasia, and Africa, Asia, and Europe into Afro-
    Eurasia.
    
    Oceanic islands are occasionally grouped with a nearby continent to divide all the 
    world's land into geographical regions. Under this scheme, most of the island 
    countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean are grouped together with the 
    continent of Australia to form the geographical region Oceania.
    
    In geology, a continent is defined as "one of Earth's major landmasses, including 
    both dry land and continental shelves". The geological continents correspond to 
    seven large areas of continental crust that are found on the tectonic plates, but 
    exclude small continental fragments such as Madagascar that are generally referred to 
    as microcontinents. Continental crust is only known to exist on Earth.
    
    The idea of continental drift gained recognition in the 20th century. It postulates 
    that the current continents formed from the breaking up of a supercontinent (Pangaea) 
    that formed hundreds of millions of years ago.
    </p>

  <h1 id="Etymology">Etymology</h1>
  <hr>
  
<p class="p">
  From the 16th century the English noun continent was derived from the term continent 
  land, meaning continuous or connected land and translated from the Latin terra 
  continens. The noun was used to mean "a connected or continuous tract of land" or 
  mainland. It was not applied only to very large areas of land‚Äîin the 17th century, 
  references were made to the continents (or mainlands) of the Isle of Man, Ireland and 
  Wales and in 1745 to Sumatra. The word continent was used in translating Greek and 
  Latin writings about the three "parts" of the world, although in the original languages 
  no word of exactly the same meaning as continent was used.
  
  While continent was used on the one hand for relatively small areas of continuous land, 
  on the other hand geographers again raised Herodotus's query about why a single large 
  landmass should be divided into separate continents. In the mid-17th century, Peter 
  Heylin wrote in his Cosmographie that "A Continent is a great quantity of Land, not 
  separated by any Sea from the rest of the World, as the whole Continent of Europe, 
  Asia, Africa." In 1727, Ephraim Chambers wrote in his Cyclop√¶dia, "The world is 
  ordinarily divided into two grand continents: the Old and the New." And in his 1752 
  atlas, Emanuel Bowen defined a continent as "a large space of dry land comprehending 
  many countries all joined together, without any separation by water. Thus Europe, Asia, 
  and Africa is one great continent, as America is another." However, the old idea of 
  Europe, Asia and Africa as "parts" of the world ultimately persisted with these being
  regarded as separate continents.

<p class="p">
    By convention, continents "are understood to be large, continuous, discrete masses of 
    land, ideally separated by expanses of water". In modern schemes with five or more 
    recognized continents, at least one pair of continents is joined by land in some 
    fashion. The criterion "large" leads to arbitrary classification: Greenland, with a 
    surface area of 2,166,086 square kilometres (836,330 sq mi), is only considered the 
    world's largest island, while Australia, at 7,617,930 square kilometres (2,941,300 sq 
    mi), is deemed the smallest continent.

    Earth's major landmasses all have coasts on a single, continuous World Ocean, which 
    is divided into several principal oceanic components by the continents and various 
    geographic criteria.

  <center><p><i>Map of island countries: these states are often grouped geographically

</aside>

<p class="p">
  The most restricted meaning of continent is that of a continuous[non-tertiary source 
  needed] area of land or mainland, with the coastline and any land boundaries forming 
  the edge of the continent. In this sense, the term continental Europe (sometimes 
  referred to in Britain as "the Continent") is used to refer to mainland Europe, 
  excluding islands such as Great Britain, Iceland, Ireland, and Malta, while the term 
  continent of Australia may refer to the mainland of Australia, excluding New Guinea, 
  Tasmania, and other nearby islands. Similarly, the continental United States refers to 
  "the 49 States (including Alaska but excluding Hawaii) located on the continent of North 
  America, and the District of Columbia."

  From the perspective of geology or physical geography, continent may be extended beyond 
  the confines of continuous dry land to include the shallow, submerged adjacent area 
  (the continental shelf)[14] and the islands on the shelf (continental islands), as 
  they are structurally part of the continent.
  
  From this perspective, the edge of the continental shelf is the true edge of the 
  continent, as shorelines vary with changes in sea level.[16] In this sense the 
  islands of Great Britain and Ireland are part of Europe, while Australia and the island 
  of New Guinea together form a continent.

  As a cultural construct, the concept of a continent may go beyond the continental shelf 
  to include oceanic islands and continental fragments. In this way, Iceland is considered 
  a part of Europe, and Madagascar a part of Africa. Extrapolating the concept to its 
  extreme, some geographers group the Australian continental landmass with other islands 
  in the Pacific Ocean into Oceania, which is usually considered a region rather than a 
  continent. This divides the entire land surface of Earth into continents, regions, or 
  quasi-continents.
</p>

<h1>Separation</h1>
<p class="p">
  The criterion that each continent is a discrete landmass is commonly relaxed due to
  historical conventions and practical use. Of the seven most globally recognized 
  continents, only Antarctica and Australia are completely separated from other continents 
  by the ocean. Several continents are defined not as absolutely distinct bodies but as 
  "more or less discrete masses of land". Africa and Asia are joined by the Isthmus of 
  Suez, and North America and South America by the Isthmus of Panama. In both cases, there 
  is no complete separation of these landmasses by water (disregarding the Suez Canal and 
  the Panama Canal, which are both narrow and shallow, as well as human-made). Both of 
  these isthmuses are very narrow compared to the bulk of the landmasses they unite.
  
  North America and South America are treated as separate continents in the 
  seven-continent model. However, they may also be viewed as a single continent known as 
  America. This viewpoint was common in the United States until World War II, and remains 
  prevalent in some Asian six-continent models. The single American continent model 
  remains a common view in France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Spain, and 
  Latin American countries.

The criterion of a discrete landmass is completely disregarded if the continuous 
landmass of Eurasia is classified as two separate continents (Asia and Europe). 
Physiographically, Europe and the Indian subcontinent are large peninsulas of the 
Eurasian landmass. However, Europe is considered a continent with its comparatively 
large land area of 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000 sq mi), while the Indian
subcontinent, with less than half that area, is considered a subcontinent. The
alternative view‚Äîin geology and geography‚Äîthat Eurasia is a single continent results in a 
six-continent view of the world. Some view the separation of Eurasia into Asia and Europe 
as a residue of Eurocentrism: "In physical, cultural and historical diversity, China and 
India are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country. 
." However, for historical and cultural reasons, the view of Europe as a separate 
continent continues in almost all categorizations.

If continents are defined strictly as discrete landmasses, embracing all the contiguous 
land of a body, then Africa, Asia, and Europe form a single continent which may be 
referred to as Afro-Eurasia. Combined with the consolidation of the Americas, this 
would produce a four-continent model consisting of Afro-Eurasia, America, Antarctica, and 
Australia.

  <p><i>Reconstruction of the supercontinent Pangaea approximately 200 million years ago</i></p>

</aside>
<p class="p">
When sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice ages, greater areas of the 
continental shelf were exposed as dry land, forming land bridges between Tasmania and the 
Australian mainland. At those times, Australia and New Guinea were a single, 
continuous continent known as Sahul. Likewise, Afro-Eurasia and the Americas were joined 
by the Bering Land Bridge. Other islands, such as Great Britain, were joined to the 
mainlands of their continents. At that time, there were just three discrete landmasses in 
the world: Africa-Eurasia-America, Antarctica, and Australia-New Guinea (Sahul).
</p>

<h1 id="geography">Other divisions</h1>

<p class="p">Apart from the current continents, the scope and meaning of the term 
  continent includes past geological ones. Supercontinents, largely in evidence earlier in 
  the geological record, are landmasses that comprise most of the world's cratons or 
  continental cores. These have included Vaalbara, Kenorland, Columbia, Rodinia, Pannotia, 
  and Pangaea. Over time, these supercontinents broke apart into large landmasses which 
  formed the present continents.</p>

<h1>Subcontinents</h1>
  
<aside class="aside_left">

  <p><i>The Indian Subcontinent</i></p>
</aside>

<p class="p">
  Certain parts of continents are recognized as subcontinents, especially the large 
  peninsulas separated from the main continental landmass by geographical features. The 
  most widely recognized example is the Indian subcontinent. The Arabian Peninsula, 
  Southern Africa, the Southern Cone of South America, and Alaska in North America might 
  be considered further examples.

  In many of these cases, the "subcontinents" concerned are on different tectonic plates 
  from the rest of the continent, providing a geological justification for the terminology.
  Greenland, generally considered the world's largest island on the northeastern 
  periphery of the North American Plate, is sometimes referred to as a subcontinent. This 
  is a significant departure from the more conventional view of a subcontinent as 
  comprising a very large peninsula on the fringe of a continent.
  
  Where the Americas are viewed as a single continent (America), it is divided into two 
  subcontinents (North America and South America) or three (Central America being the 
  third). When Eurasia is regarded as a single continent, Asia and Europe are treated as 
  subcontinents</p>

    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Zealandia%2C_topographic_map.jpg/800px-Zealandia%2C_topographic_map.jpg">
    
    <p><i>Zealandia, the largest submerged landmass or continent</i></p>
  </aside>
<h1>Submerged continents</h1>
<p class="p">
  Some areas of continental crust are largely covered by the ocean and may be considered 
  submerged continents. Notable examples are Zealandia, emerging from the ocean primarily 
  in New Zealand and New Caledonia,[non-tertiary source needed] and the almost completely 
  submerged Kerguelen Plateau in the southern Indian Ocean.

</p>

<h1>Microcontinents</h1>
<P class="p">Some islands lie on sections of continental crust that have rifted and 
  drifted apart from a main continental landmass. While not considered continents 
  because of their relatively small size, they may be considered microcontinents. 
  Madagascar, the largest example, is usually considered an island of Africa, but its 
  divergent evolution has caused it to be referred to as "the eighth continent" from a 
  biological perspective.</P>

<h1>Geological continents</h1>
<p class="p">Geologists use four key attributes to define a continent:

  Elevation ‚Äì The landmass, whether dry or submerged beneath the ocean, should be 
  elevated above the surrounding ocean crust.
  Geology ‚Äì The landmass should contain different types of rock: igneous, metamorphic, 
  and sedimentary.
  Crustal structure ‚Äì The landmass should consist of the continental crust, which is 
  thicker and has a lower seismic velocity than the oceanic crust.
  Limits and area ‚Äì The landmass should have clearly-defined boundaries and an area of
   more than one million square kilometres.
  With the addition of Zealandia in 2017, Earth currently has seven recognized geological 
  continents:<br>
  
  Africa<br>
  Antarctica<br>
  Australia<br>
  Eurasia<br>
  North America<br>
  South America<br>
  Zealandia.<br>
  Due to lacking the presence of Precambrian cratonic rocks, Zealandia's status as a 
  geological continent has been disputed by some geologists. However, a study conducted 
  in 2021 found that part of the submerged continent is indeed Precambrian, twice as old 
  as geologists had previously thought, which is further evidence that supports the 
  idea of Zealandia being a geological continent.
  
  All seven geological continents are spatially isolated by geologic features.</p>
