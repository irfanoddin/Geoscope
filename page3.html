 <p class="p">  
In the 20th century, the invention of the airplane followed by satellite
remote sensing technology added a new dimension to mapping and widened 
its scope through the method of remote sensing. This provided a bird's-eye
view of the earth and saved time and money required for conventional
surveying of ground realities.
In the broadest sense, remote sensing is the measurement 
or acquisition of information of an object or phenomenon, 
by a recording device that is not in physical or intimate contact
with the object. It is the utilization at a distance (as from aircraft, 
spacecraft, satellite, or ship) of any device for gathering information 
about the environment. The technique can make use of devices such as a camera,
laser, radar, sonar, seismograph or a gravimeter. Modern remote sensing normally
includes digital processes but can be done as well with non-digital methods.</p>
    
    <p class="p">
      
   Aerial photography is the original form of remote sensing.
   An aerial photograph can be defined as a photograph taken from
   an aircraft with a camera specially designed for aircraft use (Fig.4). 
   The occurrence of the two world wars led to a demand for aerial
   photography for military purposes. In India, acrial photographs
   have been in use since 1920 for aerial surveys and for interpretation 
   of specific fields such as topographical mapping, geology, engineering,
   environmental studies, and exploration of oil and minerals.</P>
    
<p class="p">
   attention from researchers, cartographers and general users.
   An image taken from space using a spacecraft as the platform and scanners 
   or specially designed cameras as sensors to detect the given area of the earth's
   surface is termed satellite imagery (Fig. 5). The remote sensor system makes
   use of the emitted or reflected electromagnetic radiation of the examined 
   object and measures a larger area of the earth. Satellite imagery can be 
   widely applied and is extensively used by scientists, researchers, 
   and planners in map-making, urban and regional planning, agriculture, 
   forestry, ecology and environment, soil survey, natural resource mapping,
   oil and mineral exploration, and so on.

    <p class="p">
   GIS (Geographical Information Systems), the database, analysis, and display are physically and conceptually separate aspects. Geographic information systems include several elements such as computer hardware, software, digital data, people, and institutions for collecting, storing, retrieving, analyzing, and displaying georeferenced data or information about the Earth. Modern map-making relies much more on GIS, which provides flexible computer-aided database and maps.
    </p>

  <h1> Scale</h1>
  <p class="p">
A scale is essential for reading a map accurately. It is defined as
the ratio between two points on the ground and their corresponding 
distance on a piece of paper (the map). A scale can be expressed as:<br><br>
<b>1. Representative Fraction (R.F.)</b><br>
The units of measurement of distances 
are the same both on the ground and on paper.
It is always expressed as a ratio, e.g. 1:100,000,
where 1 cm on the map represents 100,000 cm or 1 inch = 100,000 inches.<br><br>

<b>2. Written statement</b><br>
The system of measurement is clearly stated, e.g. 1 cm = 1 km
or 1 inch 1 mile<br><br>

<b> 3. Graphical method</b><br>
A diagram of a ruler is drawn to show the given scale,
e.g. 1 cm = 1 km or 1:100,000. A segment of a ruler measuring 
15 cm will represent 15 km.
