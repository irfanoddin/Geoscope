            The Earth's crust is not a single continuous layer. 
            It is a made up of a number of gigantic pieces like a 
            huge jigsaw puzzle. Each piece is called a crustal plate.
            Currents of molten rock rise up through the mantle like boiling 
            water in a saucepan. These form convection cells that drive the 
            movement of the plates so that they are continuously moving away or 
            towards each other. Geologically, the most important things happen at 
            the plate boundaries, including most of the earthquakes, volcanoes, igneous
            rocks, major metamorphism, and mountain building processes. There are 10 
            crustal plates:

1. Pacific
2. South American
3. Cocos
4. Antarctic
5. Nazca
6. Australian
7. Indian
8. North American
9. African
10. Eurasian

  Alfred Wegener (1880-1930), a German meteorologist and geologist, was the 
  first person to propose the theory of continental drift. In his book, Origin
  of Continents and Oceans, he calculated that 200 million years ago the
  continents were originally joined together, forming a large supercontinent. 
  He named this supercontinent Pangaea, meaning 'All-earth'. Pangaea split into
  plates to form Eurasia in the north and Gondwanaland in the south. Further
  splitting over millions of years formed the continents as we know them today.
  Wegener's concept was originally based on the apparent 'jigsaw' fit. 
  The continents look as if they were pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle 
  that could fit together to make one giant super- continent. The bulge 
  of Africa fits the shape of the coast of North America while Brazil fits
  along the coast of Africa beneath the bulge. There are three kinds of plate
  boundaries:
Divergent boundaries are where plates separate from each other, and magma oozes up from the mantle into the crack (a fissure volcano) making the ocean basin wider. This is known as sea floor spreading.
Convergent boundaries are where plates come together, but to do so one of the plates must dive below the surface into the mantle along a subduction zone. These often result in deep-sea trenches. Convergent boundaries also produce mountain chains and
very large, explosive volcanoes. Plates slide past each other where transform boundaries occur, ideally with little or no vertical movement. Most transform boundaries are below sea level and therefore not easy to see. The San Andreas fault in California is a transform boundary. It has been estimated that these plates are moving at a speed of 1 to 10 cm per year.

<h1>Rocks and Minerals</h1>
<p class="p">Rocks are the substances that make up the Earth. 
They include loose and unconsolidated deposits, as well as the hard,
solid parts that make up the Earth's lithosphere. Rocks can be
classified into three main groups on the basis of their origin- 
igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic. Minerals are the building
materials of rocks. Rocks may be composed of only one mineral,
while others contain many of them.</p>

            Sedimentary (stratified or<br>
             layered) rocks are formed by <br>
             the collection of sediments <br>
             over a long span of time, e.g.<br>
              sandstone and shale.

            Metamorphic rocks are formed when <br>
            the nature of any rock is altered by<br>
             subjecting it to intense heat and/or pressure,<br>
              e.g. graphite (from coal)<br>
               and quartzite (from sandstone).
